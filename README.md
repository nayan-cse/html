# ðŸ©º Pathological Test Prediction System Using Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Pathological Test Prediction System**, an intelligent healthcare solution designed to assist patients in identifying potential illnesses, recommending necessary pathological tests, and guiding them toward appropriate medical specialists. This system also generates a personalized prescription, providing a seamless and efficient experience for users.

## ðŸš€ **Project Overview**

This project aims to build an interactive system where:

1. **Symptom Assessment**: Patients describe their symptoms, and the system asks relevant follow-up questions to gather comprehensive details.
2. **Illness Prediction**: Based on the provided information, the system predicts possible illnesses using advanced **Machine Learning algorithms**.
3. **Test Recommendation**: It identifies and recommends the pathological tests required for diagnosis.
4. **Specialist Suggestion**: The system advises which type of specialist the patient should consult.
5. **Prescription Generation**: A dynamically generated prescription includes:
   - Patient's reported symptoms.
   - Suggested pathological tests.
   - Specialist recommendation.
